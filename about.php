         <p>JP group of educational institutions, a group comprising of various educational organizations in Western UP, Located at 5kms from the city centre and 65 kms from delhi is easily accessible by rail and road. It is about 2hours drive by road from the Delhi airport. As quality education can usher in an era of comprehensive development of all citizens of India, hence JP Educational Trust Society started its journey in the field of education by laying the foundation of a school, known as JP Academy; (Nursery to XII), a leading school in Uttar Pradesh. The JP Educational Trust Society also gave shape to professional colleges so that the youth can seek self satisfying jobs. Thus came up JP Institute of Hotel Management and Catering Technology, JP Institute of Education, JP Institute of Applied Sciences and JP Institute of Engineering and Technology. The field of its vision was not restricted to Meerut and it saw a school JP International School in Greater Noida too. In tune with its thinking and vision is the creation of JP School of Business.</p>

         <p>Late Smt. Krishna Agarwal w/o Sh. J. P. Agarwal the Chairman of the society, is the guiding soul and inspiration behind the creation of JP Academy. She dreamt of creating schools, where the student feels at home and education becomes a pleasurable and enjoyable experience. When she established her first school in Meerut, that is - JP Academy, she personally ensured that the students were provided the best available educational infrastructure in the country. Besides educational wherewithal she created salubrious environment with nature at its best manifestation. Smt. Krishna Agarwal believed that the beauty of nature coupled with parental like care by the teachers can create a true and inspiring educational ambience where the student willingly learns. We here, at JP Academy have committed our selves to turn her dreams into reality.</p>

              <p>The Academy as a co- educational Resident cum Day school came into existence in the year 1995 with Sh Atal Bihari Vajpayee our ex-Prime Minister laying its foundation stone. The school has since then marched on from success to success. It is a matter of great pride for me to see our alumni and alumnae occupying respectable positions in almost all walks of life and contributing to nation building. Our ex-students are not only doing well in the professional and occupational fields but have also excelled in Games and Sports too. The aim of education that we pursue at JP Academy is in consonance with high Indian ideals. According to Herbert Spencer, the ideal of ancient education in India was, "Training for completeness of life and moulding of character of men and women " And according to British Sanskrit scholar Arthur Anthony Macdonell (1854-1930) the aim of education in ancient India was the manifestation of divinity in Man. These aims touch the highest point of knowledge and we endeavour to follow these aims at J P Academy.</p>

              <p>I understand that our Government and specially the CBSE Board is focusing on these ideals and lofty aims. I am sure with advent of CCE we will see young-men and women of rock like character being churned out of schools.</p>

              <p>With profound belief and hope.</p>

                  <p>Based on the above Vedic hymn, which means Lead me towards truth from untruth, lead me towards light from darkness and lead me towards immortality from death, flows the educational philosophy of JP Academy. We strive towards truth and light expelling ignorance. The attainment of highest knowledge, creation of pious and virtuous young men and women is our credo. All this shaping and sharpening of learners takes place in friendly, cooperative and enabling environment. The teaching as well as administrative staff have been directed and instructed by me to look at every child like his/her own and take up their duties in a nobler manner so that the young minds bloom with aromatic fragrance. To ensure real all round development in all facets of personality, physical, mental, spiritual, creative, aesthetic we have provided all the where- withals. And since learning is a dynamic process we ensure updating our pedagogy as well as class support system. An integral part of our learning process will have our students community learning how to question, solve problems and make thoughtful decisions. In the days to come each class room will be upgraded with modern technology to make the process of learning more joyful and effective. I have pledged to provide the best and I will do so for my students, since they are the soul ofJP Academy.</p>

                  <p>All stake holders, parents, students, 
                      teachers, educationists and employers,  
                      have been questioning the efficacy of 
                      the modern day education system, 
                      Students have degrees but they are 
                      not found worthy of employment Inside 
                      and outside the school the behaviour 
                      and conduct of students has been found wanting They indulge in violent behaviour because of
                      poor value system inculcated in them, Not only boys are involved in such incidences, girls too have been seen indulging in organized violent acts. The suicidal tendencies are on the
                      increase Control over emotions is missing. Peace and tolerance is giving way to anger and
                      disrespect. All this compels us to think whether the education being imparted in schools and
                      colleges is serving its aim of creating a healthy and happy society or not.
                      Swami Vivekananda wanted education to be man-making by which character is formed.
                      strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded and by which one can stand on one's
                      own feet. Swami Vivekananda said "Human mind is not a bottomless dry well, which has to be filled with buckets of information by the teacher education has more to do with assimilation of ideas and developing a mind of material as that of thunderbolt' He advocated that let education be half of Western Science and the other half-the Vedanta System.  
                      According to J Krishnamurthy the years which a student spends in school must leave behind
                      him a fragrance of delight All this can happen when there is no competition, no authority.
                      where teaching and learning is a simultaneous process, where the educator and the educated are both participating in the act of learning Here at J P Academy we are carrying forward the ethos of CBSE by considering each child as Individual and that all children are creative and all need to succeed. We foster a caring and creative environment and emphasize on social emotional, physical and intellectual development of such child We establish values that will allow him to act with thoughtfulness and humanity, We provide excellent learning opportunities, by creating multiple learning, will be major expenditure on CT (information and Communicative Technology with Smart Classes being  the order of the day in J P Academy. And we rededicate ourselves to provide very best  to our students by further developing knowledge attitudes and skills so essential for quality future life.

                <p>Knowledge in the twenty-first century is growing at exponential speed throwing up challenged each day to the teachers as well as students. Chalk and talk method of teaching -learning is giving space to ICT (Information and Communication Technology) oriented classroom transactions. Here at J P Academy we are in perfect sync with latest pedagogy and tuned to give our best to the students. We are aware that the future challenges which our students will face when they step into the world of careers will be tougher and demanding. To ensure that our students are not found wanting in any sphere we imbibe in them leadership traits along with sound academic knowledge. Our infrastructure is at par with international parameters with ample opportunities for all round development of our children.
</p>
                <p>
       Continuous guidance and counselling is part and parcel of our academic routine. The teenager problems are handled with care and compassion by matured teachers who interact with girl students separately and boys separately. Safety and security of each child is our top priority. We firmly believe that each child can be a winner with adequate and timely support from the school and parents alike. I want my students to remember what Stephan Hawking said and I quote ,

   <p> I am sanguine that all students stepping into J P Academy will succeed with flying colours.
