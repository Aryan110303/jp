                  <p>All stake holders, parents, students, 
                      teachers, educationists and employers,  
                      have been questioning the efficacy of 
                      the modern day education system, 
                      Students have degrees but they are 
                      not found worthy of employment Inside 
                      and outside the school the behaviour 
                      and conduct of students has been found wanting They indulge in violent behaviour because of
                      poor value system inculcated in them, Not only boys are involved in such incidences, girls too have been seen indulging in organized violent acts. The suicidal tendencies are on the
                      increase Control over emotions is missing. Peace and tolerance is giving way to anger and
                      disrespect. All this compels us to think whether the education being imparted in schools and
                      colleges is serving its aim of creating a healthy and happy society or not.
                      Swami Vivekananda wanted education to be man-making by which character is formed.
                      strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded and by which one can stand on one's
                      own feet. Swami Vivekananda said "Human mind is not a bottomless dry well, which has to be filled with buckets of information by the teacher education has more to do with assimilation of ideas and developing a mind of material as that of thunderbolt' He advocated that let education be half of Western Science and the other half-the Vedanta System.  
                      According to J Krishnamurthy the years which a student spends in school must leave behind
                      him a fragrance of delight All this can happen when there is no competition, no authority.
                      where teaching and learning is a simultaneous process, where the educator and the educated are both participating in the act of learning Here at J P Academy we are carrying forward the ethos of CBSE by considering each child as Individual and that all children are creative and all need to succeed.

And we rededicate ourselves to provide very best  to our students by further developing knowledge attitudes and skills so essential for quality future life.
