              <p>The Academy as a co- educational Resident cum Day school came into existence in the year 1995 with Sh Atal Bihari Vajpayee our ex-Prime Minister laying its foundation stone. The school has since then marched on from success to success. It is a matter of great pride for me to see our alumni and alumnae occupying respectable positions in almost all walks of life and contributing to nation building. Our ex-students are not only doing well in the professional and occupational fields but have also excelled in Games and Sports too. The aim of education that we pursue at JP Academy is in consonance with high Indian ideals. According to Herbert Spencer, the ideal of ancient education in India was, "Training for completeness of life and moulding of character of men and women " And according to British Sanskrit scholar Arthur Anthony Macdonell (1854-1930) the aim of education in ancient India was the manifestation of divinity in Man. These aims touch the highest point of knowledge and we endeavour to follow these aims at J P Academy.</p>
              <p>I understand that our Government and specially the CBSE Board is focusing on these ideals and lofty aims. I am sure with advent of CCE we will see young-men and women of rock like character being churned out of schools.</p>
              <p>With profound belief and hope.</p>
