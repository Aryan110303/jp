             <p>Boys and Girls are located separately. The hostels are provided with room-coolers, geysers and fly-proofing. The hostels have ayahs (for girls) and ward boys (for Boys) besides female and male wardens who look after the students round the clock.</p>

              <p>The Campus has all the components of a residential School. The academic-block is aesthetically designed and tastefully constructed. There are two messes, located near girls and boys hostels. The messes are fitted with cooking-gas burners, modern pantry, automatic dish-washers and an appealing dining-hall with charming chairs. The mess facility is operational throughout the year. A very high degree of hygiene and sanitation is ensured and the food prepared caters to every palate.</p>

              <p>The school has its own clinic to provide medical attention to the students under the care of a qualified doctor who resides in the campus and is ably supported by a medical compounder. A ten bedded hospital exists for temporary admission of patients.</p>
