        <p>Educational process has to be dynamic so as to absorb and keep abreast with ail the changes that are taking place in the world all over in the fields of science, humanities and teaching methods. It is our endeavour to blend the traditional methods with the modern developments to retain balance.</p>

        <p>The focus is on the child, his educational needs, his strengths and his weak areas. Through individual attention, we ensure that education becomes a joyful, happy and rewarding experience.</p>

        <p>Teaching is packaged with friendliness, affection and concern for each child. There is friendly interaction with the teachers who are easily accessible to the students. Ample opportunities are provided to the students for self study and learning through peer groups.</p>

        <p>There is judicious mix of studies with ports and co-curricular activities. Wherever possible, theoretical teaching is followed by practical application. At junior level, it is ensured that the students move from concrete to abstract in agraduated and planned manner.</p>

        <p>We are conscious of the fact that the slow learner should not hamper the progress of the bright students. The slow learners are additionally coached to catch up with the bright ones. We believe that each slow learner is basically a flier and if given proper guidance. encouragement and motivation he/she too can attain great heights.</p>

        <p>We foster in them love for God, care and concern for fellow beings and love for nature. Emphasis is on character building qualities. Discipline enforced does not inhibit a child but ensures his orderly growth. We try to make them models of excellent conduct and behaviour.</p>

        <p>JP Boarding house is a 'Sweet Home Away from Home' where the boys' and girls' upbringing is under the watchful and affectionate care of the House Warden and his Staff. Sharing and caring is the chief feature of life on the campus.</p>

        <p>JP Academy is a venture in faith, faith that our students will do our Institution and our country proud.</p>
