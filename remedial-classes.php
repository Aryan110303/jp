             <p>Special attention is given to students weak in English and Maths. They are put through remedial classes. Hand picked tachers are assigned this task, who get down to the basic level of the students and gradually bring up the level of the students upto their class level. It is seen that there are psychological factors which hamper their education. An effort is made to bring them out of the feeling of insecurity and lack of confidence by focusing on their strong points and intrinsic abilities. Our methods do not work wonders but make appreciable progress for many a weak students.</p>
